## 📝 Notes

### About the Logo
The Seven Sefirot logo represents the Kabbalistic concept of spiritual ascension through seven stages (Chesed to Malchut). The spiral formation symbolizes:
- Non-linear leadership growth
- Cyclical learning and development
- Balance between structure and flow
- Ancient wisdom meeting modern leadership

This design maintains professional appeal while carrying deep meaning for those familiar with Kabbalistic symbolism.

### Content Philosophy
All content emphasizes:
- **Substantive over inspirational**: Frameworks and tools, not just motivation
- **Experiential learning**: Active participation, not passive lectures
- **Cultural intelligence**: Adapted to real workplace dynamics
- **Immediate applicability**: Tools participants can use right away
